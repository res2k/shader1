# The INPUT_FILTER tag can be used to specify a program that doxygen should
# invoke to filter for each input file. Doxygen will invoke the filter program
# by executing (via popen()) the command <filter> <input-file>, where <filter>
# is the value of the INPUT_FILTER tag, and <input-file> is the name of an
# input file. Doxygen will then use the output that the filter program writes
# to standard output.
# If FILTER_PATTERNS is specified, this tag will be
# ignored.

# only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of
# the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the
# path to strip. Note that you specify absolute paths here, but also
# relative paths, which will be relative from the directory where doxygen is
# started.
