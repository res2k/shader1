# by executing (via popen()) the command <filter> <input-file>, where <filter>
# is the value of the INPUT_FILTER tag, and <input-file> is the name of an
# input file. Doxygen will then use the output that the filter program writes
# to standard output.
# If FILTER_PATTERNS is specified, this tag will be
# ignored.
