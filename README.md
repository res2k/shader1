# shader1
S1 is a compiler for "unified" shader programs: instead of having to write multiple programs,
a developer writes single program, and the splitting into the multiple programs for the different
pipeline steps is done automatically. This reduces the effort needed to write shaders, but can also
offer new opportunities for optimizations across the different programs.
